/**
 * International-payment surcharge (added Sep 8, 2026, per direct
 * request): the extra cost of accepting a non-Indian card —
 * Razorpay's higher international transaction fee, plus any forex
 * spread — is now passed on to the parent as a surcharge added on
 * top of the base price, instead of Learniee absorbing it.
 *
 * This SUPERSEDES the older decision documented in the file header
 * of src/lib/razorpay.ts, which explicitly chose not to add any
 * markup and to let the parent's own bank handle conversion
 * invisibly. That comment is now stale — this file is the current
 * source of truth for how international payments are priced.
 *
 * Detection caveat: Razorpay only knows a card's issuing country
 * *after* a charge attempt, so we can't price the order differently
 * per-card before Checkout even opens. Instead this uses the
 * parent's own onboarding answer (self-declared "Indian" vs "NRI",
 * `ParentProfile.nriOrIndian`, falling back to `.country`) as a
 * proxy for "will this likely be an international card". This is an
 * approximation, not a guarantee — flagging it the same way
 * 06-OPEN-DECISIONS.md #37 flags the underlying pricing formula, so
 * it doesn't get treated as a settled fact later. Worth revisiting
 * once real payment data shows how often the self-declared flag and
 * the actual card country disagree.

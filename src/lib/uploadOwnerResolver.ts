 * Teacher's id via an identical lookup; this used to be two
 * copy-pasted blocks in presign/route.ts. CHILD_PHOTOS resolves to
 * the requesting Parent's id. HOMEWORK is used by both roles (Teacher
 * attaching reference material, Parent uploading a submission) so it
 * checks the token's own `custom:role` claim rather than assuming —
 * ownership of the specific Homework/Enrollment row is still enforced
 * separately in homework.service.ts, this only decides whose id the

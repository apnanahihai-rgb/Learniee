 * The session-flow rules of Part 1B, as pure functions (no database,

 * server (`sessionFlow.service.ts`, `sessionResolve.service.ts`,
 * `rescheduleRequest.service.ts`) and the client (the Start / Join /
 * End buttons), so a button is enabled by exactly the rule the server
 * enforces.
 *
 * Only cycle-model sessions (those with `startsAt`/`endsAt`) use any
 * of this. Legacy sessions never reach it.
 *
 * Outcome table (Part 1B §3):
 *
 *   both joined, overlap >= 50%      COMPLETED        counts, paid
 *   teacher there, student absent    STUDENT_NO_SHOW  counts, paid
 *   student there, teacher absent    TEACHER_NO_SHOW  does not count
 *   nobody joined                    CANCELLED (system) does not count
 *   both joined, overlap < 50%       NEEDS_REVIEW     pending (Admin)
 *   parent cancels 4h+ ahead         CANCELLED        does not count
 *   parent cancels under 4h          CANCELLED_LATE   counts, paid
 *   teacher cancels                  CANCELLED        does not count
 *
 * The last three rows are set by the cancel action, not by resolve.

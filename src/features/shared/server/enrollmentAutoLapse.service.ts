/**
 * Enrollment auto-lapse (resolves 06-OPEN-DECISIONS.md #27 /
 * 04-BUILD-PLAN-TIMELINE.md Week 3's carried-over gap): a
 * `LAPSED` status value and `Enrollment.lastClassAt` field have
 * existed since Sep 1, 2026, but nothing ever actually flipped a
 * stale enrollment to `LAPSED` — this file is that missing piece,
 * now that `ClassSession` (built Sep 4) gives it something real to
 * check against.
 *
 * Rule: an `ACTIVE` enrollment with no class *conducted* (a real
 * `ClassSession` marked `COMPLETED`, not merely scheduled) in the
 * last `LAPSE_THRESHOLD_DAYS` days lapses automatically.
 *
 * Reference date per enrollment, in priority order:
 *   1. `lastClassAt` — set every time a session is marked complete
 *      (`classSession.service.ts`), the most accurate signal.
 *   2. `adminApprovedAt` — when the enrollment actually became
 *      `ACTIVE` (dual-approval's last step), used when no class has
 *      ever been completed yet.
 *   3. `cycleStartDate` — falls back further only if `adminApprovedAt`
 *      is somehow missing on an already-`ACTIVE` row.
 *
 * `LAPSED` is intentionally NOT a terminal/deleted state — it stays
 * in `GENERATION_STATUSES`/`CALENDAR_STATUSES`
 * (`classSession.service.ts` / `scheduleOccurrences.service.ts`), so
 * existing history, Chat, and Homework remain visible. Re-activating
 * a `LAPSED` enrollment back to `ACTIVE` is not built yet — flagged
 * as the natural next question in 06-OPEN-DECISIONS.md #34, not
 * something this file decides on its own.

/**
 * Cycle close (Part 1C §4 and §5, adjusted by Part 2B §1). A
 * cycle-model cycle CLOSES when every session is final (and any
 * no-show / teacher-cancel follow-up applied), or on day 45 at the
 * latest. Unfinished and uncounted sessions are forfeited: no
 * refund, no teacher pay.
 *
 * Closing writes, in ONE transaction, the cycle: `CLOSED`, when, why,
 * counted and forfeited totals (what Part 2A / `releaseClosedCyclePayout`
 * read). The transaction starts with a lock on the cycle row and a
 * conditional `OPEN -> CLOSED` update, so a cycle closes exactly once
 * however many triggers reach it, and no make-up can be added while
 * it is deciding.
 *
 * CLOSED is not the same as SETTLED: "final" (used to decide close)
 * only means every session's outcome and follow-up are done — it
 * says nothing about the parent's 48-hour confirmation window or an
 * open dispute. The payout ledger row is written separately, by
 * `releaseClosedCyclePayout()` below, only once the cycle is BOTH
 * closed AND every session in it has `settledAt` set — so an open
 * dispute holds the payout even after the cycle itself has closed.
 * Also decided here: whether the Enrollment is done (no renewal by
 * the time this cycle closed) — see `enrollmentCompletion.service.ts`.
 *
 * Triggers (no host-specific scheduler): after every follow-up, and
 * `closeDueCycles()` from the same sweep as resolve
 * (`/api/cron/resolve-sessions`). Legacy enrollments never come here.

/**
 * Follow-ups after a cycle session reaches a final outcome (Part 1C):
 *
 *   teacher no-show   make-up + strike + Admin alert
 *   nobody joined     make-up
 *   teacher cancel    make-up + strike
 *   student no-show   notice to the parent
 *
 * Each follow-up happens ONCE. The whole database side (claim,
 * make-up, strike) runs in one transaction that starts by setting
 * `ClassSession.followUpAppliedAt` with a conditional update — the
 * request that wins that update does the work, every other request
 * (a repeat, a concurrent trigger, the sweep) finds it already set and
 * does nothing. Make-ups and strikes are also unique per session in
 * the database, so even a bug here could not create a second one.
 * Notifications go out after commit, from the winner only.
 *
 * A session with no make-up that fits inside the cycle's 45 days
 * simply stays uncounted; it is forfeited when the cycle closes.
 *
 * Triggered from the same three places as `resolveSession` (the End
 * tap / cancel, a read after the end time, the sweep) — the sweep
 * calls `repairPendingFollowUps` for anything a request left behind.
 * Never throws: the outcome is already saved.

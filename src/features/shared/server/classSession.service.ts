/**
 * ClassSession — the actual record of a class happening (or being
 * scheduled to happen), tied to a real date/time. Resolves the
 * single biggest MVP gap flagged in 07-LESSONS-LEARNED.md /
 * 03-DATA-MODEL.md: before this, "sessions completed" was a blind
 * Teacher-only counter click (the old `cycleProgress.service.ts`,
 * now a thin compatibility wrapper around this file) with no record
 * of which date it corresponded to, and the Tuition Ledger's
 * CCC/MCC/TCC columns were hardcoded to 0
 * (`features/accounts/server/export.service.ts`) because there was
 * nothing to count.
 *
 * Rows are generated from an Enrollment's recurring
 * `scheduleDays`/`scheduleTime` (same convention the old
 * `scheduleOccurrences.service.ts` used to compute on the fly — that
 * file now reads from this table instead), so a session's
 * date/time/status is a real, stored fact that survives a later
 * schedule change: editing `scheduleDays`/`scheduleTime` only
 * regenerates *future*, still-SCHEDULED rows
 * (`regenerateFutureSessions`), never rewrites COMPLETED/CANCELLED
 * history.
 *
 * Generation is lazy/idempotent (`ensureSessionsGenerated`) rather
 * than cron-driven — there's no job runner in this project yet
 * (06-OPEN-DECISIONS.md has no ReminderJob/cron entity either), so
 * it's called opportunistically from the calendar routes, the
 * per-enrollment sessions list, and the mark-complete flow. The
 * `[enrollmentId, scheduledDate]` unique constraint makes repeated
 * generation calls safe (`skipDuplicates`).

 * `cycleProgress.service.ts` did before this file replaced it —
 * this must stay wired or Accounts' payout-verification queue goes
 * silently dark. Both writes happen in one transaction so the
 * cycle-progress update and the ledger entry can't drift apart.
 * `cyclesCompleted` increasing versus the pre-update row is what
 * "a cycle just completed" means here (rather than re-checking
 * `sessionsCompletedInCycle === 0`), since deriving from the
 * all-time count can jump straight past a cycle boundary if a
 * Teacher marks several overdue sessions complete at once —
 * `createLedgerEntryForCompletedCycle` is still safe to call once
 * per resulting cycle number even so, via its own
 * unique-constraint/P2002 idempotency guard.

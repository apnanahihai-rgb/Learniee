/**

 * count: brings the cycle's counted / forfeited totals in line, and —
 * ONLY if this cycle's payout already released (Part 2B) — corrects
 * its existing ledger row too (see `reconcileLedgerEntryForClosedCycle`
 * for exactly what is and isn't touched). If the payout hasn't
 * released yet, the corrected total is left for `releaseClosedCyclePayout()`
 * (called right after this by the caller) to read once the cycle is
 * fully settled — writing a ledger row here would skip that gate.
 * Returns warnings.
